/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal finance data. Users can only access their own data.
 * @dataStructure All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that each user has a private data tree.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - Listing of all users is disallowed.
 *   - Shared expenses are disallowed.
 *   - Strict ownership is enforced on all resources to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization Not applicable, as the data structure inherently enforces ownership via the /users/{userId} path.
 * @structuralSegregation Not applicable, as the model focuses on private user data.
