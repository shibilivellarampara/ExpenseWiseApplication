/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Expense Tracker App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data.  Each user has a private data tree rooted at `/users/{userId}`.
 * Only the authenticated user matching the `userId` segment has read and write access to the data within that tree.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Individual expense records.
 * - /users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId}: User's financial accounts.
 * - /users/{userId}/contributions/{contributionId}: Contribution records.
 * - /users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}: Expense categories.
 * - /users/{userId}/tags/{tagId}: Expense tags.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles can only be created by themselves (self-creation).  Updates are allowed, but the userId cannot be changed.
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 * - Ambiguous relationships default to strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To avoid `get()` calls in rules, all documents within a user's data tree should include a `userId` field that matches the `userId` segment of the path.
