/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for ExpenseWise Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their own profile and associated expenses and contributions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Expenses are stored in `/users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}`.
 * - Contributions are stored in `/users/{userId}/contributions/{contributionId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Data consistency between the path and the document's internal fields is enforced.
 * - No public listing of expenses or contributions is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is present in both the path and the document data for expenses and contributions, allowing for efficient ownership checks.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User profiles and associated data are segregated under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring that users can only access their own data.
