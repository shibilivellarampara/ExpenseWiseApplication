/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Expense Tracker application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has a dedicated
 * data tree under `/users/{userId}` where they can store their profile, expenses,
 * categories, payment methods, and tags. No cross-user access is permitted except
 * when explicitly designed through shared documents (not implemented in this version).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user-specific data is nested under `/users/{userId}`:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: UserProfile document.
 * - `/users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}`: Expense documents.
 * - `/users/{userId}/contributions/{contributionId}`: Contribution documents.
 * - `/users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}`: Category documents.
 * - `/users/{userId}/paymentMethods/{paymentMethodId}`: PaymentMethod documents.
 * - `/users/{userId}/tags/{tagId}`: Tag documents.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to prevent unauthorized data discovery.
 * - All write operations require authentication (`request.auth != null`).
 * - Data validation is limited to authorization-critical fields (e.g., userId).
 * - Read access to user profiles is restricted to the profile owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - Each document under `/users/{userId}` contains the `userId` field.
 *    This denormalization simplifies the security rules by avoiding the need to
 *    extract the user ID from the document path.
