/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Expense Tracker App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Only the authenticated user who owns a specific
 * data record (UserProfile, Expense, Category, etc.) can read, create, update, or delete it.  All data
 * is nested under /users/{userId} to ensure clear ownership.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, creating a clear ownership hierarchy.  Each user's data
 * (expenses, categories, payment methods, etc.) resides under their unique user ID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed:  There are no rules that allow listing all users in the database.
 * - Strict ownership: All write operations are restricted to the owner of the document, based on the `userId` in both the path and the document data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Each document (Expense, Category, PaymentMethod, Tag) contains a `userId` field that MUST match the
 * `{userId}` in the document path. This is enforced on `create` and `update` to prevent unauthorized
 * data access.
