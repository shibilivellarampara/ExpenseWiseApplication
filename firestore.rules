/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Expense Tracker App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only access
 * and modify data that belongs to them. All data is nested under /users/{userId},
 * ensuring clear ownership. Shared expenses (contributions) are not supported in this version of the rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores individual expense records.
 * - /users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId}: Stores user-defined account information.
 * - /users/{userId}/contributions/{contributionId}: Stores contribution records for shared expenses.
 * - /users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}: Stores user-defined expense categories.
 * - /users/{userId}/tags/{tagId}: Stores user-defined tags for expenses.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly disallowed.
 * - Data validation is limited to fields critical for authorization (e.g., userId).
 * - Shared expenses are disallowed in the current security rules, so `shared_expenses` is denied.
