/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Expense Tracker App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full
 * control over their own data, and no access to other users' data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Individual expense records for a user.
 * - /users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId}: User's financial accounts.
 * - /users/{userId}/contributions/{contributionId}: Contribution records.
 * - /users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}: Expense categories defined by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/tags/{tagId}: Tags defined by the user for categorization.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own data. Listing other users' data is disallowed.
 * - User profiles can only be created by the user themselves (self-creation).
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) require the user to be the owner of the data.
 * - Validation of request data is minimized for rapid prototyping. Only critical authorization fields and relational integrity are checked.
