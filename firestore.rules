/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExpenseWise application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data. Each user
 * has full control over their own profile, expenses, and contributions. No
 * cross-user access is permitted.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense records for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/contributions/{contributionId}: Stores contribution records for a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly denied (no top-level `allow list` rule for `/users`).
 * - Only authenticated users can access data.
 * - All data is nested under `/users/{userId}`, ensuring clear ownership.
 * - No data validation is performed beyond checking ownership.
