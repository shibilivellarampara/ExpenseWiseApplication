/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Expense Tracker application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that users can only
 * access their own data. Shared access is supported for shared expenses feature.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Contains user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Contains expense records owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/accounts/{accountId}: Contains financial account information owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/contributions/{contributionId}: Contains contribution records owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}: Contains expense categories owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/tags/{tagId}: Contains expense tags owned by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete data under their own user ID.
 * - No listing of all users is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - User ID is included in all documents to simplify ownership checks and improve rule performance.
