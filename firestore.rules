/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExpenseWise.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only
 * access their own profile data and the expenses/contributions associated with their account.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. The `userId` must match the
 *   authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense records for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/contributions/{contributionId}: Stores contribution records for a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user profile.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete expenses and contributions associated
 *   with their user ID.
 * - Listing of other user profiles is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - Expenses and contributions are stored as subcollections of the `users/{userId}` document to
 *    enforce authorization based solely on the `userId` in `request.auth.uid`, avoiding `get()` calls.
