/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ExpenseWise application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for profile data,
 * expenses, and contributions.  Each user can only access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. The userId corresponds
 *   to the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/expenses/{expenseId}: Stores expense records for a specific user.
 * - /users/{userId}/contributions/{contributionId}: Stores contribution records for a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own profile.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete expenses under their own profile.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete contributions under their own profile.
 * - Listing other user's expenses or contributions is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   The data model uses path-based authorization; the userId is encoded in the
 *   document path.  Rules will check that request.auth.uid matches the userId
 *   in the path. This avoids the need for extra reads to determine ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *   User profiles and associated expenses/contributions are stored in separate
 *   collections to maintain a clear security boundary.
